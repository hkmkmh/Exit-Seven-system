# Exit-Seven-system
Capstone Project at Data Science and AI Bootcamp at SDAIA
This project implements an automated traffic management system aimed at optimizing congestion management at major street entrances in urban areas.

## Project Overview
Exit Seven focuses on enhancing traffic flow and management by utilizing existing street cameras and advanced computer vision techniques. The system analyzes real-time video feeds to assess congestion levels and make informed decisions about managing street entrances. By automating the closure of exits based on traffic conditions, this project aims to improve congestion management and reduce reliance on manual interventions. The system leverages advanced computer vision techniques, particularly YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, to accurately detect and analyze traffic conditions in real-time. Additionally, an LLM (Large Language Model) is integrated to facilitate communication between traffic officers and the system, allowing officers to chat for real-time updates, queries, and context-aware insights. This enhances decision-making and coordination, making the traffic management process more efficient and responsive.

## Problem Statement
Traffic congestion is a significant issue in Riyadh, particularly during peak hours, leading to:

* Increased travel times and frustration for commuters.
* Inefficient traffic management relying on police officers manually closing entries.
* A reactive approach to congestion, rather than proactive solutions.
* The necessity for a streamlined response to manage traffic flow effectively.

## Features
* Automated Traffic Management: Utilizes YOLO models to assess traffic conditions and autonomously close or open street entrances based on real-time analysis.
* Data-Driven Decisions: The system bases its actions on continuous analysis of traffic metrics, ensuring proactive management.
* AI Chatbot: An LLM (Large Language Model), specifically Llama-7b, is integrated to facilitate communication between traffic officers and the system, allowing officers to chat for real-time updates, queries, and context-aware insights.

## Methodology
The project utilizes computer vision techniques, specifically YOLOv8, along with fine-tuning and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) to enhance small object detection performance. Additionally, it employs NLP and LLM technology, specifically Llama-7b, to improve communication and provide valuable insights.

## Results
The ExitSeven system effectively identifies congestion and autonomously manages street entrances, reducing traffic delays and improving overall road efficiency.
